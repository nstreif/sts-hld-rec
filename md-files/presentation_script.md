# Presentation Script: Start to Scale Workbook Design Framework

**Total Time: 12-15 minutes max**

---

## OPENING (30 seconds)

"Thanks for making time. We're here for one decision: approval to execute this design framework for the workbook. I'll walk through the approach in 12 minutes, then we can discuss."

---

## TITLE SLIDE (10 seconds)

"Start to Scale Workbook Design Framework."

[Advance immediately]

## SLIDE 1: DESIGN TRUTHS (90 seconds)

"Three truths guide every design decision:

**First**: STS is dense. We can't cover everything—we focus on highest-impact concepts only.

**Second**: Everything is connected, but we present one main idea at a time. Otherwise learners get overwhelmed.

**Third**: Learners want fast action. Each chapter delivers standalone value in 15-30 minutes.

These truths lead directly to our design principles."

[Pause 2 seconds, advance]

## SLIDE 2: CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (60 seconds)

"Three principles shape the workbook structure:

**Self-contained with bridges**: Each chapter stands alone. No dependencies that block progress—only bridges to relevant chapters.

**Concrete deliverables**: One tangible, shareable artifact per chapter and phase. Users leave with something they can use immediately.

**Modular design**: Supports sequential reading or jumping to specific chapters. Users work where they need to."

## SLIDE 3: TARGET USER (45 seconds)

"Who's this for?

**Primary**: Solo founder or small team operator actively scaling.

**Also serves**: Leadership teams, solo founders.

**Not built for**: Large teams, passive readers, or academic audiences.

This matters because every exercise adapts for both solo work and small team use."

---

## SLIDE 4: USING THE WORKBOOK (30 seconds)

"Three usage principles:

Each phase stands alone. Each chapter stands alone. But completing all chapters in a phase delivers maximum value.

Translation: Users can jump in anywhere based on their biggest pain point, but we incentivize completing phases for full impact."

---

## SLIDE 5: PHASE OVERVIEW (60 seconds)

"Five phases, 10 chapters total.

**Barriers**: One diagnostic chapter. Identifies what's blocking scale.

**People**: Two chapters—diagnostic plus core values template.

**Strategy**: Three chapters—de-hassle, brand promise, strategic plan.

**Execution**: Three chapters—focus, quarterly theme, meeting rhythm.

**Cash**: One diagnostic covering financial acceleration.

Each phase ends with a culminating activity—an integrated artifact that synthesizes the phase's work."

---

## SLIDE 6: THE ARCHITECTURE (90 seconds)

"Every chapter follows one of three archetypes:

**Diagnostic chapters**: Use triage to identify focus areas, then users complete only relevant deep dives. Example: Chapter 1 identifies your scaling barrier, then directs you to the phase that solves it.

**Template chapters**: Build a specific artifact step-by-step. Example: Chapter 6 creates your one-page strategic plan.

**Framework chapters**: Apply a methodology to your situation. Example: Chapter 4 uses de-hassle thinking to eliminate friction.

Why archetypes? Consistency. Users learn the pattern once, then move faster through subsequent chapters."

---

## SLIDE 7: CHAPTER PATTERNS (90 seconds)

"All chapters share the same bookends: Opening, then unique middle, then Bridge.

**Diagnostic pattern**: 
- Quick assessment
- Conditional deep dives—you complete only what's relevant
- Action plan synthesizes your path
- Total time: 15-30 minutes

**Template pattern**: 
- Framework explanation
- Step-by-step worksheet
- One deliverable
- Total time: 20-30 minutes

**Framework pattern**: 
- Model with examples
- Application exercise
- Output and next action
- Total time: 15-25 minutes

The key innovation: diagnostic chapters use conditional sections. Rate 6 areas, identify your 2 lowest scores, deep dive only there. Users do targeted work, not exhaustive work."

---

## SLIDE 8: NEXT STEPS (60 seconds)

"Three steps:

**First**: We need binary yes/no on this design approach today. If approved, we execute using this framework.

**Second**: With approval, we build all 10 chapters plus 5 phase-culminating activities using the archetype patterns.

**Third**: We've already drafted Chapter 2 as a proof of concept—happy to review that example if helpful.

Questions?"

## HANDLING Q&A

### If asked "How is this different from a typical workbook?"
"Most workbooks are linear—complete page 1 before page 2. We're modular. Users can start at their pain point. And we use conditional sections so they complete only relevant exercises, not every exercise in the book."

### If asked "What if users skip around and miss connections?"
"Each chapter ends with a bridge—if X revealed Y, see Chapter Z. We guide them without blocking progress. Plus the phase-culminating activities integrate the work."

### If asked "How do you prevent overwhelm with all these options?"
"Diagnostic chapters triage immediately. You rate areas, see your two lowest scores, those become your focus. We tell users explicitly: skip sections that don't apply. Permission-giving language throughout."

### If asked "What's your confidence level in this approach?"
"High. The design principles come directly from learning experience design best practices—modular structure, just-in-time learning, concrete deliverables. Plus it solves the core problem: STS has too much density for a traditional linear workbook."

### If asked about timeline
"Depends on approval today. With yes, we execute chapter-by-chapter using these archetypes. Each chapter takes [X time based on your actual timeline]. Full workbook complete by [your deadline]."

## CLOSING

"That's the framework. The decision we need: Does this modular, archetype-based approach work for the Start to Scale workbook? Yes or no?"

[Wait for response. Don't fill silence.]
