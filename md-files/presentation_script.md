# Presentation Script: Start to Scale Workbook Design Framework

**Total Time: 15-20 minutes (including Q&A)**

---

## PRE-MEETING FRAME (30 seconds)

"Thanks for taking the time to meet. I want to walk you through the design framework we've developed for the Start to Scale workbook and get your feedback. My goal is a clear yes or no on this approach so we know whether to proceed. The presentation is about 12 minutes, leaving time for discussion."

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE (10 seconds)

**Start to Scale Workbook - Design Framework**

**[Pause briefly]**

"Let me walk you through how we're structuring this."

---

## SLIDE 2: CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (2 minutes)

**[Point to the four principles on screen]**

"We've organized the entire workbook around four core design principles."

**Self-contained with bridges:**
"First: each chapter and phase is self-contained with bridges to other relevant phases, not dependencies that block progress. Users should be able to jump to the chapter they need without being forced through everything before it."

**One concrete deliverable:**
"Second: one concrete, shareable deliverable per chapter and phase. Every time someone completes a chapter, they walk away with an actual tool or artifact they can use."

**Modular design:**
"Third: modular design that supports sequential or standalone use. Users can work through the workbook front to back, or they can jump to Chapter 6 because that's where they're stuck right now."

**Targeted work over comprehensive work:**
"Fourth: users complete 15 to 30 minutes of focused work, not 60 minutes of exhaustive processing. We use triage and conditional sections to guide users to what matters most for their situation."

**Transition:**
"These principles directly shape who this is for..."

---

## SLIDE 3: TARGET USER PROFILE (1 minute)

**Primary:**
"Our primary user is a founder or operator scaling a company—likely solo or with a small team."

**Also serves:**
"This also serves leadership teams and solo founders who need to work through the material on their own."

**Not for:**
"Importantly, this is not designed for passive readers or academic audiences. That clarity lets us stay focused on practical, action-oriented exercises."

**Transition:**
"So how does this actually work for users?"

---

## SLIDE 4: USING THE WORKBOOK (45 seconds)

**[Read the three statements clearly]**

"Each phase can stand on its own."

**[Pause]**

"Each chapter can stand on its own."  

**[Pause]**

"Completing all chapters in a phase delivers maximum value."

**Clarify:**
"So users can engage at the phase level, the chapter level, or work through entire phases for the full benefit. All three approaches are designed to work."

**Transition:**
"Here's what that structure looks like..."

---

## SLIDE 5: PHASE OVERVIEW (1.5 minutes)

**[Point to screen]**

"Ten chapters organized into five phases, following the Scaling Up methodology."

**Walk through quickly:**

"Phase one: Barriers. Chapter 1 diagnostic, with a Barrier-to-Solution Map as the culminating activity."

"Phase two: People. Chapters 2 and 3, culminating in an integrated FACe and PACe deliverable."

"Phase three: Strategy. Chapters 4, 5, and 6, culminating in a Vision Summary."

"Phase four: Execution. Chapters 7, 8, and 9, culminating in the Rockefeller Habits Checklist."

"Phase five: Cash. Chapter 10, culminating in Power of One plus CASh."

**Key point:**
"Each phase ends with a culminating activity that integrates the chapter work into a single artifact."

**Transition:**
"Now here's the core design innovation..."

---

## SLIDE 6: THE ARCHITECTURE - THREE CHAPTER TYPES (2 minutes)

**[Point to the three cards]**

"Not all chapters should work the same way, so we've created three chapter archetypes."

**Diagnostic:**
"Diagnostic chapters are for identifying what's broken or where to focus. Examples: Chapter 1 on Barriers, Chapter 2 on Right People/Right Things, Chapter 10 on Cash."

**Template:**
"Template chapters are for creating a specific artifact or plan. Examples: Chapter 3 for Core Values, Chapter 6 for the OPSP, Chapter 8 for Quarterly Theme."

**Framework:**
"Framework chapters are for applying a methodology to your current situation. Examples: Chapter 4 on De-Hassle, Chapter 5 on Brand Promise, Chapter 7 on Top 1 of 5."

**The key:**
"By matching the chapter structure to what that content needs to accomplish, we make each chapter as efficient and effective as possible."

**Transition:**
"Let me show you what each of these patterns looks like..."

---

## SLIDE 7: CHAPTER PATTERNS BY TYPE (2.5 minutes)

**[Point to the yellow callout box]**

"All chapters share the same bookends: Opening and Bridge. But the middle differs based on the archetype."

**Diagnostic:**
**[Point to left column]**

"Diagnostic chapters follow this pattern: Opening, then a concept summary covering 3 to 4 key concepts. Then a universal assessment—a quick triage exercise that everyone completes. That includes an explicit filter that directs users to complete only the sections relevant to their situation."

"Next are conditional deep dives—modular sections that users complete selectively based on their assessment. Each deep dive is self-contained and takes 5 to 10 minutes max."

"Then an action plan that synthesizes only what the user completed in their deep dives. And finally, contextual bridges to the next relevant chapter or phase."

**Template:**
**[Point to middle column]**

"Template chapters are simpler: Opening, concept summary explaining the framework, then the template or worksheet with step-by-step completion and examples. Then the bridge."

**Framework:**
**[Point to right column]**

"Framework chapters: Opening, then framework explanation with real examples, then an application exercise where users apply it to their situation. Then an output or next action section explaining what to do with the completed work. Then the bridge."

**Key insight:**
"Each pattern is optimized for a different job. Diagnostics triage and target. Templates build artifacts. Frameworks teach and apply."

**Transition:**
"So what happens next?"

---

## SLIDE 8: NEXT STEPS (1 minute)

**Review Chapter 2:**
"We've built Chapter 2—the Right People/Right Things/Right Way Assessment—as a full example of the diagnostic archetype. I'm seeking a binary yes or no on this design approach."

**With Approval:**
"If this framework works, we'll begin executing all chapters and phases using this design framework. Each chapter follows its appropriate archetype pattern."

**Deliverables:**
"Ten chapters plus five phase-culminating activities."

**Close:**
"That's the framework. What questions do you have?"

**[Pause and wait for questions]**

---

## Q&A PREPARATION

### Likely Questions & Responses:

**Q: "How is this different from other workbooks?"**
A: "The conditional design. In diagnostic chapters, users only complete the deep dives relevant to their situation. Someone with solid people practices can skip those sections entirely. And each chapter is designed around a specific archetype—diagnostic, template, or framework—so the structure matches what that content needs to accomplish."

**Q: "Will solo founders be able to use this?"**
A: "Yes, every exercise includes adaptation notes for solo founders versus small teams. We've designed with that primary user in mind from the start."

**Q: "What if someone skips chapters?"**
A: "That's the point of self-contained design. Each chapter has what it needs to stand alone. The bridges at the end suggest where to go next, but nothing is blocked by skipping earlier chapters."

**Q: "How do you handle the density of Scaling Up concepts?"**
A: "Through triage in the diagnostic chapters. Instead of forcing users through all six concepts, we help them assess and identify their two weakest areas, then they only complete deep dives in those areas. Targeted work over comprehensive work."

**Q: "What about the bridges between chapters?"**
A: "Each chapter ends with contextual bridges that suggest next steps based on what the chapter work revealed. They're suggestions, not requirements. Users can follow them or chart their own path."

**Q: "How long until this is done?"**
A: "With framework approval, we can [provide realistic timeline based on your capacity and resources]."

**Q: "Can you show me an example?"**
A: "Yes, Chapter 2 is complete and demonstrates the diagnostic archetype. I can walk you through it now or send it for your review."

## HANDLING SPECIFIC SCENARIOS

### If they ask to see Chapter 2 immediately:
"Absolutely. Chapter 2 is the Right People/Right Things/Right Way Assessment. It starts with a quick universal assessment where users rate six areas, then based on their lowest scores, they complete only the relevant deep dives. I can pull it up now if you'd like."

### If they express concern about complexity:
"That's exactly why we use the triage approach in diagnostic chapters. If a founder's people practices are solid, they skip those deep dives. The workbook adapts to what each user needs, rather than forcing everyone through everything."

### If they ask about time commitment:
"Each chapter is designed for 15 to 30 minutes of work. Diagnostic chapters can be even faster if you score well on the assessment—you only complete what's relevant. Template and framework chapters walk you through building one artifact, which keeps the scope focused."

### If they want to see the full chapter list:
**[Reference Slide 5]**
"The phase overview shows all ten chapters. Would it be helpful to walk through any specific phase in more detail?"

### If they ask about your confidence in this approach:
"We built this framework specifically for the Start to Scale context—dense material that needs to be actionable for busy founders. The archetype approach lets us match structure to purpose, and the conditional design respects that not every founder needs to work on every concept."

## CLOSING OPTIONS

**If they approve:**
"Great, thank you. I'll move forward with executing the remaining chapters using this framework. I'll circle back with updates as we complete each phase."

**If they have concerns:**
"I understand. What specifically would you want to see changed or clarified before we proceed?"

**If they're unsure:**
"Would it help to review Chapter 2 together? That might make the framework more concrete and help you decide if this approach will work."

**If they want time to think:**
"Of course. I can send you Chapter 2 for review and we can reconvene after you've had a chance to look at it."
