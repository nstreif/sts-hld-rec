# Presentation Script: Start to Scale Workbook Design Framework
## [UPDATED - Control-Focused Version]

**Total Time: 20-25 minutes (including discussion)**
**Approach: Direct, efficient, decision-driven**

---

## PRE-MEETING FRAME (30 seconds)

"Thanks for your time today. I'm going to walk you through our design framework for the Start to Scale workbook, then demonstrate Chapter 2 as a working example. At the end, I need two specific decisions from you, which I'll make explicit. The whole presentation is about 15 minutes, then we'll discuss and decide. Let's get started."

**[Start slides immediately]**

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE (5 seconds)

**[Read, advance immediately]**

"Start to Scale Workbook - Design Framework Review."

---

## SLIDE 2: CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (90 seconds)

**[Point to the three cards]**

"Three core principles guide everything we've built."

**Self-contained with bridges:**
"Each chapter stands alone. No dependencies that block someone from jumping to Chapter 6 if that's where they need to start."

**Concrete deliverables:**
"Every chapter produces a tangible tool or artifact. Not insights—actual deliverables they can use."

**Modular design:**
"Users can go sequential or jump around. Both paths work."

**[Advance immediately—don't wait for questions]**

---

## SLIDE 3: TARGET USER PROFILE (45 seconds)

**Primary:**
"Primary user: founder or operator working through this independently."

**Also serves:**
"Also works for leadership teams, solo founders, people working with STS Coaches."

**Not for:**
"Not designed for passive readers or academic use."

**[Advance immediately]**

---

## SLIDE 4: USING THE WORKBOOK (30 seconds)

**[Read the three statements]**

"Each phase stands alone. Each chapter stands alone. Completing all chapters in a phase delivers maximum value."

**Brief clarification:**
"Users engage at whatever level they need—phase, chapter, or full workbook."

**[Advance immediately]**

---

## SLIDE 5: QUESTIONS? (1 minute)

**[Pause here deliberately]**

"Before I show you the specific chapters and phases, let me pause. Any questions on the foundation—the principles, the target user, or how this gets used?"

**[Field questions briefly]**
- Keep answers tight
- If question is about details: "Let me show you that in the phase overview"
- If no questions: "Great. Let me show you what we're building."

**[Advance when ready]**

---

## SLIDE 6: PHASE OVERVIEW (90 seconds)

**[Point to screen]**

"Ten chapters across five phases. Here's what we're building."

**Walk through quickly:**
"Phase 1: Barriers—one diagnostic chapter, Barrier-to-Solution Map deliverable."

"Phase 2: People—two chapters including Chapter 2 that I'll demo. Integrated FACe and PACe as the culminating deliverable."

"Phase 3: Strategy—three chapters covering De-Hassle, Brand Promise, OPSP. Vision Summary as culminating deliverable."

"Phase 4: Execution—three chapters on focus, themes, meeting rhythms. Rockefeller Habits Checklist."

"Phase 5: Cash—one chapter, Power of One plus CASh deliverable."

**Key point:**
"Notice: each phase produces one integrated artifact at the end."

**Transition:**
"That's what we're building. Now let me show you how it actually works."

**[Advance—or switch to Chapter 2 document]**

---

## CHAPTER 2 DEMONSTRATION (5 minutes)

**[Open Chapter 2 if not already visible]**

**Setup (15 seconds):**
"Chapter 2 is the Right People/Right Things/Right Way Assessment. This demonstrates our diagnostic archetype. Let me show you the flow."

**Part 1: The Triage (60 seconds)**
**[Scroll to Section 1]**

"Every user starts here: Six-Circle Quick Assessment. Rate six areas 1 to 5. Takes about 5 minutes."

**[Point to the filter instruction]**

"Then—this is the key design element—they identify their two lowest scores and complete only the deep dives relevant to those scores. Explicit permission to skip what doesn't apply."

**Part 2: Conditional Deep Dives (90 seconds)**
**[Scroll to Section 2]**

"Section 2 has seven deep dive modules. Users complete only what's relevant."

**[Point to Deep Dive A]**

"Each starts with a clear IF condition: 'Complete this if Employees scored 1-3.'"

**[Show the pattern quickly]**

"If Employees and Sell are their lowest scores, they complete those two deep dives—about 15 minutes total. They skip the other five."

**Emphasize:**
"This is the efficiency: targeted work based on the assessment, not forcing everyone through everything."

**Part 3: Action Plan (45 seconds)**
**[Scroll to Section 3]**

"Action plan synthesizes only what they completed in their deep dives. Not re-processing everything—just focusing their priorities based on what they worked on."

**Part 4: Bridge (30 seconds)**
**[Scroll to Section 4]**

"Every chapter ends with a bridge: clear paths forward based on what the chapter revealed. Three options, not seven. Plus a default if they're unsure."

**Wrap (15 seconds):**
"That's the diagnostic archetype in action: triage, targeted deep dives, action plan, bridge."

**[Return to slides or pause]**

---

## SLIDE 7: NEXT STEPS (45 seconds)

**[Advance to this slide]**

"So next steps if we move forward:"

**Review Chapter 2:**
"You've now seen Chapter 2 as the diagnostic example. I need a binary yes or no on this approach."

**With approval:**
"We execute all 10 chapters plus 5 culminating activities using this framework."

**Deliverables:**
"Ten standalone chapters, five phase integrations."

**[Advance immediately]**

---

## SLIDE 8: DECISION POINTS (2 minutes)

**[Point to Decision 1]**

"Here are the two decisions I need from you today."

**Decision 1: Framework Approval**
"First: Can we move forward with this design framework? Binary yes or no. If there are concerns, tell me specifically what needs to change."

**[Pause—wait for response]**

**Decision 2: Review Cycle**
"Second: If yes, what's your preferred review process?"

**[Point to the recommendation box]**

"Our recommendation: we send you one complete phase at a time. This limits your review burden while giving you iterative feedback opportunities throughout development."

**[Pause—wait for response]**

**Clarify logistics:**
"Does that work? Or would you prefer a different review cadence?"

---

## DISCUSSION & ALIGNMENT (5-10 minutes)

**After getting the two decisions, cover alignment points:**

**On persona:**
"One clarification: we've designed this assuming independent use as the primary path—founder at their laptop. Each activity includes adaptations for working with a coach or team. Does that primary-independent approach work for you?"

**On growth tools:**
"Second: we're integrating your existing growth tools—FACe, PACe, OPSP—throughout. Not creating new frameworks, just adapting what already works for the workbook format. Thoughts?"

**Field any remaining questions:**
- Keep answers direct
- If question requires detail: "Let me pull up the appendix" **[go to Slides 9-10 if needed]**
- If question is out of scope: "That's a great question for later—right now I need to confirm whether this framework works"

---

## CLOSE (1 minute)

**Recap what was decided:**

"So to confirm: **[repeat the decisions]**"

"Review process: **[repeat what was agreed]**"

"Timeline: We'll deliver **[first phase/deliverable]** by **[date]**."

**Final check:**
"Anything else we need to address before we start executing?"

**Thank and end:**
"Great. Thank you for the feedback. We'll get started and send you **[next deliverable]** by **[date]**."

---

## APPENDIX SLIDES (USE ONLY IF NEEDED)

**Slides 9-10 are there if:**
- Someone asks: "Can you explain the three chapter types in more detail?"
- Someone asks: "How does the diagnostic pattern differ from template or framework?"
- You need to prove a specific design choice

**Don't proactively present these unless asked.**

---

## CONTROL TACTICS

### 1. Own the Pace
- Don't ask permission to advance slides
- Advance when you're done talking, not when they might have questions
- Use Slide 5 as your only deliberate pause point

### 2. Redirect Efficiently
- If question is about detail you'll cover: "I'll show you that in just a moment"
- If question derails: "That's important—let me finish this thought first, then we'll come back to it"
- If discussion wanders: "Let me bring us back to the decision we need: does this framework work?"

### 3. Make Direct Asks
- Slide 8 is your anchor: "I need two decisions from you"
- Don't hint. Don't ask "what do you think?" Ask "Can we move forward?"
- Wait for clear answers—silence is okay

### 4. Use Your Mentor Strategically
- Before your direct asks: They can add context or credibility
- During Q&A: They can handle questions about strategic fit or broader context
- When you make the ask: You lead, they support

### 5. Time-Box Discussions
- If a question takes >2 minutes: "This is a good discussion—can we note this and come back to it after we get the framework decision?"
- If someone goes deep on Chapter 2 content: "I appreciate the engagement with the content—right now I need to know if the structure works"

---

## IF THINGS GO OFF TRACK

### If they want to review every chapter detail:
"I appreciate the thorough review, but right now I need a decision on the framework itself. If the framework works, we can discuss chapter-level details as we build them."

### If they're non-committal:
"I understand you may need time, but to keep this project moving, I need to know: what specifically would you need to see or know to make a yes/no decision?"

### If the answer is no:
"Okay. Can you tell me specifically what doesn't work? Is it the archetype approach, the time commitment, the deliverable format, something else?"

### If they keep asking for more examples:
"Chapter 2 is our proof point for diagnostics. Would it help if we built one Template and one Framework chapter as comparisons, then reconvene? Or do you need something else?"

---

## SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Walking out with:
- ✅ Clear YES or NO on framework
- ✅ Agreement on what we're building (10 chapters + 5 culminating activities)  
- ✅ Defined review process
- ✅ Timeline for next deliverable
- ✅ No ambiguity about scope or expectations

---

## KEY PHRASES TO USE

1. **"I need two decisions from you today"** - Sets expectation for outcome
2. **"Binary yes or no"** - No room for vagueness
3. **"If there are concerns, tell me specifically what needs to change"** - Forces clarity
4. **"Let me bring us back to the decision"** - Redirects when discussions wander
5. **"To keep this project moving..."** - Creates urgency for decision

---

## MINDSET

**You are not asking for permission. You are presenting a solution and getting a decision.**

- Confident, not apologetic
- Direct, not tentative  
- Decision-focused, not consensus-seeking
- Time-conscious, not rambling

**Your job: Present clearly → Demonstrate effectively → Get clear decisions → Execute**
