# Practice Plan: Breaking the Teaching Habit

## Your Current Pattern (What to Avoid)
- **Assume they didn't understand** → Explain same point 2-3 different ways
- **Fill every silence** → Over-elaborate instead of pausing
- **Check for understanding** → Ask "Does that make sense?" repeatedly
- **Soften statements** → Use qualifiers that dilute impact

## Your New Pattern (Executive Mode)
- **Assume they're smart and busy** → Say it once, clearly
- **Embrace silence** → Pause after key points, let them think
- **Trust your words** → If unclear, they'll ask
- **Be direct** → Make declarative statements

## PRACTICE SESSION 1: The 90-Second Drill (Day 1)

**Goal**: Say each slide's content in 90 seconds or less without looking at script.

**Method**:
1. Set timer for 90 seconds
2. Look at slide
3. Deliver content
4. STOP when timer ends, even mid-sentence

**Success criteria**: You finished the key points before timer ended.

**What to notice**: 
- Did you repeat yourself?
- Did you say "does that make sense?" or similar?
- Did you use filler words (like, um, so, actually)?

**Repeat each slide 3 times** until you can consistently finish in time.

## PRACTICE SESSION 2: The One-Shot Rule (Day 1-2)

**Goal**: Explain each concept exactly once, then move on.

**Method**:
1. Deliver one slide
2. Record yourself (voice memo on phone)
3. Listen back
4. Mark every time you:
   - Restated the same point
   - Said "in other words"
   - Gave a third example when two would do

**Revision**: Re-record, cutting all redundancy.

**Target**: Zero repetition per slide.

---

## PRACTICE SESSION 3: Silence Tolerance (Day 2)

**Goal**: Get comfortable with 2-3 second pauses after key statements.

**Method**:
1. Read each bolded statement in script
2. Count "one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi" silently
3. Then continue

**Practice these specific pauses**:
- After: "These three truths guide every decision" [PAUSE]
- After: "Users can jump in anywhere based on their pain point" [PAUSE]
- After: "Each chapter follows one of three archetypes" [PAUSE]
- After closing question: "Yes or no?" [PAUSE - count to 5]

**Why this matters**: Executives process fast. Your pause = their processing time. Your filling that pause = you sounding nervous or unsure.

---

## PRACTICE SESSION 4: Full Run-Through (Day 2-3)

**Goal**: Deliver entire presentation in 12-15 minutes.

**Method**:
1. Set timer for 15 minutes
2. Present to empty room (or record video)
3. Track your actual time per slide
4. Note where you went over

**Adjust**: If you're hitting 18+ minutes, you're over-explaining. Cut examples, not concepts.

**Target pace**:
- Title: 10 seconds
- Slide 1 (Design Truths): 90 seconds
- Slide 2 (Core Design Principles): 60 seconds
- Slide 3 (Target User): 45 seconds
- Slide 4 (Using Workbook): 30 seconds
- Slide 5 (Phase Overview): 60 seconds
- Slide 6 (Architecture): 90 seconds
- Slide 7 (Chapter Patterns): 90 seconds
- Slide 8 (Next Steps): 60 seconds
- Q&A buffer: 3-5 minutes

---

## PRACTICE SESSION 5: The Mirror Test (Day 3)

**Goal**: Deliver with confident body language.

**Method**:
1. Stand in front of mirror
2. Deliver full presentation
3. Watch for:
   - Fidgeting
   - Apologetic gestures (hand-wringing, shrugging)
   - Looking down when making bold statements

**Fix**: 
- Plant feet shoulder-width
- Use deliberate hand gestures only to emphasize key words
- Make direct eye contact with imaginary audience during bold statements

---

## PRACTICE SESSION 6: The Interrupt Drill (Day 3-4)

**Goal**: Handle questions without losing your place or momentum.

**Method**:
1. Have someone interrupt you randomly during practice
2. Practice this sequence:
   - Pause immediately
   - Answer briefly (30 seconds max)
   - Return with: "So [quick recap of where you were]..."

**Common interruption**: "Wait, can you explain that again?"

**Your response**: "Happy to clarify—which part?" [They specify] [You explain that one thing] "Good? Okay, moving on..."

**What NOT to do**: Re-explain everything you just said.

---

## PRACTICE SESSION 7: The Pressure Test (Day 4)

**Goal**: Deliver under realistic pressure.

**Method**:
1. Present to colleague/friend who plays "busy executive"
2. They should:
   - Check phone occasionally (to make you nervous)
   - Interrupt with tough questions
   - Look skeptical at random moments

**Your job**: Stay on script, stay on time, don't let their reactions make you over-explain.

## DAY-OF-PRESENTATION CHECKLIST

### 30 minutes before:
- [ ] Review script once (don't re-memorize)
- [ ] Practice your opening line 3 times
- [ ] Practice your closing line 3 times
- [ ] Do the silence tolerance exercise (count to 3 after key statements)

### Right before:
- [ ] Take 3 deep breaths
- [ ] Remind yourself: "They're smart. They'll ask if confused."
- [ ] Commit to your target: 12-15 minutes for presentation

### During presentation:
- [ ] If you catch yourself repeating: STOP mid-sentence, say "Moving on..."
- [ ] If you catch yourself saying "Does that make sense?": DON'T. Just advance.
- [ ] Count to 2 after each major point before continuing
- [ ] After closing question: Count to 5 in your head. Stay silent.

---

## EMERGENCY BRAKE PHRASES

If you catch yourself rambling mid-sentence:

**Use these**:
- "Bottom line: [restate in one sentence]"
- "Let me land this: [single clear point]"
- "Actually, moving on..."
- "Short version: [one sentence], next slide"

**Practice saying these out loud 5 times** so they feel natural.

## MINDSET RESET

**Before the meeting, read this:**

You are NOT teaching a classroom of students who need concepts explained 3 different ways.

You ARE briefing executives who:
- Read fast
- Process fast  
- Value their time
- Will ask if confused
- Want to make a decision, not receive education

Your job: Give them enough information to decide. Then stop talking.

**This meeting succeeds if**:
- You finish in 12-15 minutes
- You get a yes/no decision
- You didn't repeat yourself

**This meeting does NOT require**:
- Perfect explanations
- Everyone "getting it" completely
- You feeling like you taught them enough

Trust your content. Trust your audience. Say it once. Stop.

---

## POST-PRESENTATION DEBRIEF

After the meeting, note:
- Times you repeated yourself (count them)
- Times you said "Does that make sense?" or similar (count them)
- Longest silence you held before speaking (estimate seconds)
- Did you finish in 15 minutes or less? (Y/N)
- Did you get a decision? (Y/N)

Use this data to improve for next time.
