# Chapter 2 Walkthrough Script

**Purpose:** Demonstrate the diagnostic archetype in action
**Time:** 5-7 minutes
**Goal:** Show how triage → conditional deep dives → action plan actually works

---

## SETUP (30 seconds)

"Let me walk you through Chapter 2 as a concrete example of the diagnostic archetype. This is the Right People/Right Things/Right Way Assessment. I'll show you how the triage-to-deep-dive pattern keeps this efficient."

**[Have Chapter 2 ready to scroll through]**

---

## PART 1: THE TRIAGE (1 minute)

**[Scroll to Section 1]**

"Every user starts here with the Six-Circle Quick Assessment. They rate six areas on a 1-to-5 scale—three on the people side, three on the activities side. This takes about 5 minutes."

**[Point to the rating boxes]**

"Then—and this is the key design element—they identify their two lowest scores. One from the left side, one from the right side."

**[Point to the "Identify your two lowest scores" section]**

"Here's the explicit filter:"

**[Read the instruction]**

"'These are your focus areas. Complete only the deep dive sections below that relate to these two circles.'"

**Key point:**
"This is permission-giving language. If someone scores 4s and 5s across the board, they're done. They skip Section 2 entirely and go straight to the bridge. That's a 10-minute chapter. But if they have two areas at 1-3, they continue to the relevant deep dives."

---

## PART 2: THE CONDITIONAL DEEP DIVES (2 minutes)

**[Scroll to Section 2]**

"Section 2 has seven deep dive modules—A through G—one for each concept area. Users complete only what's relevant to their two lowest scores."

**[Point to Deep Dive A]**

"Each deep dive starts with a clear IF condition. Deep Dive A says: 'Complete this if Employees scored 1-3.'"

**Show the pattern:**

"If their lowest left-side score was Employees, they complete Deep Dive A—the rehire question exercise. Takes 5-10 minutes. They list key people and answer 'would I enthusiastically rehire them today?'"

**[Point to Deep Dive D]**

"If their lowest right-side score was Sell, they complete Deep Dive D—diagnosing whether the issue is Better, Faster, or Cheaper. Another 5-10 minutes."

**[Scroll past the other deep dives quickly]**

"They skip B, C, E, F, and G entirely because those circles aren't their focus areas."

**Emphasize:**
"This is the efficiency. Instead of forcing everyone through all seven deep dives—which would be 45-60 minutes of work—users complete only 2-3 modules based on what their assessment revealed. Total time: 15-25 minutes."

---

## PART 3: THE ACTION PLAN (1 minute)

**[Scroll to Section 3]**

"Section 3 is the action plan. Notice it doesn't ask users to re-process everything from Section 1. It synthesizes only the work they completed in Section 2."

**[Point to the two priority boxes]**

"They identify one priority from the left side, one from the right side. They specify Get/Keep/Grow or Better/Faster/Cheaper. They name what's broken and who owns fixing it."

**Key design:**
"This emerges from the deep dives they completed, not from re-analyzing the universal assessment. The work flows forward—triage leads to targeted deep dives, deep dives lead to focused action plan."

---

## PART 4: THE BRIDGE (1 minute)

**[Scroll to Section 4]**

"Every chapter ends with a bridge. Notice this offers three clear paths, not seven."

**[Point to the three options]**

"Stay in People Phase if you discovered people problems or accountability gaps."

"Jump to Strategy Phase if your people are solid but lack direction."

"Jump to Execution Phase if strategy is clear but execution is inconsistent."

**[Point to the default at the bottom]**

"And there's a default: 'If you're still unsure, fix People Phase issues first.' No one gets stuck in decision paralysis."

---

## THE PAYOFF (30 seconds)

**Summary:**

"So to recap: Someone with solid practices completes Section 1, sees their scores are 4-5, and they're done in 10 minutes. Someone with issues completes Section 1, identifies two focus areas, completes 2-3 targeted deep dives, builds their action plan, and they're done in 25 minutes. No one spends 60 minutes working through irrelevant material."

**The proof:**
"This is the diagnostic archetype working as designed. Universal assessment with explicit filter. Conditional deep dives. Action plan from completed work. Contextual bridge."

**Close:**
"Does this demonstrate what we're building?"

## IF THEY ASK QUESTIONS

### "How does this work if someone skipped Chapter 1?"

**A:** "Section 1 stands alone—you don't need any prior chapter to rate these six areas. The concept summary at the top gives you the framework. The deep dives are self-contained. Someone jumping straight to Chapter 2 can complete it fully."

### "What if someone wants to complete all the deep dives?"

**A:** "They can, but we explicitly give permission to skip what's not relevant. The design serves busy founders who need targeted work. If someone wants comprehensive, they can do that—but we're not forcing it."

### "How do you know which deep dives to include?"

**A:** "Each deep dive maps to one of the six circles in the Right Things Right model. If that circle scored low, that deep dive is relevant. The model provides the structure."

### "What makes this different from just listing all six areas?"

**A:** "The triage. Most workbooks would say 'now assess all six areas in detail.' We say 'assess quickly, then go deep only where it hurts.' That respects time and focuses effort."

### "Show me a deep dive in detail"

**[Scroll to Deep Dive A or D]**

**A:** "Each deep dive has a clear structure: IF condition at the top, diagnostic questions in the middle, 'who owns fixing this' at the bottom. Self-contained, actionable, time-bounded."

## TIMING BREAKDOWN

If this walkthrough needs to be shorter, prioritize:
- **Part 1 (Triage)** - Must include, this is the foundation
- **Part 2 (Conditional Deep Dives)** - Must include, this is the innovation
- **Part 4 (The Bridge)** - Must include, this proves the modular design
- **Part 3 (Action Plan)** - Can be briefer if needed

If you have extra time, emphasize:
- The explicit permission language throughout
- How someone could be done in 10 minutes vs. 25 minutes
- The "complete only what's relevant" design principle in action

## KEY PHRASES TO USE

These reinforce the presentation framework:

1. **"Universal assessment with explicit filter"** - This is archetype language
2. **"Conditional deep dives—complete only what's relevant"** - Permission-giving design
3. **"15-25 minutes of targeted work, not 60 minutes of comprehensive work"** - Time efficiency
4. **"Self-contained—works even if you skipped Chapter 1"** - Modular design
5. **"Action plan synthesizes only the work you completed"** - No re-processing

---

## CONFIDENCE NOTES

**You know this chapter inside and out.** Don't read it word-for-word. Just:
- Point to sections
- Explain the pattern
- Show the flow
- Prove the framework

**The chapter speaks for itself.** Your job is to narrate how the diagnostic archetype manifests in the actual design.

**This is proof, not persuasion.** You're demonstrating that what you presented in the slides actually works in practice.
