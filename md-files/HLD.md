# High-Level Design (HLD): Start to Scale Workbook

## Key Design Truths

These truths guide every design decision:

1. **STS is dense** — The workbook must focus on highest-impact concepts per chapter
2. **Everything is connected** — Focus on one main idea at a time to avoid overwhelming learners
3. **Learners want fast action** — Each part delivers standalone value

## Core Design Principles

### Self-contained with bridges
Each chapter and phase is self-contained with bridges to other relevant chapters, not dependencies that block progress.

### Concrete deliverables
One concrete, shareable deliverable per chapter and phase.

### Modular design
Supports sequential or standalone use — learners can jump in where they need to.

## Target User Profile (Workbook)

### Primary
Founder or operator scaling a company.

### Also serves
Leadership teams, scale-up facilitators.

### Not for
Passive readers or academic study.

## Chapter-Level Design Pattern

Every chapter follows this structure:

### 1. Opening
Clear trigger ("Start here if...")

### 2. Core
Plain summary + processing activities

### 3. Deliverable
One-page artifact, reusable & shareable

### 4. Bridge
Connects to next chapter/phase

## Phase-Level Integration

Each phase addresses a critical scaling dimension:

- **Barriers**: Spot where scale is breaking
- **People**: Align behavior and capacity
- **Strategy**: Clarify choices and positioning
- **Execution**: Turn intent into cadence
- **Cash**: Ensure fuel for growth

### Key Points
- Each phase can stand on its own
- Each chapter can stand on its own
- Completing all chapters in a phase delivers maximum value

## Phase/Chapter Structure

### Phase: Barriers
- Ch 1: Your Scaling Barrier Diagnostic
- **Culminating Activity**: Barrier-to-Solution Map (Your #1 barrier + which phase(s) address it)

### Phase: People
- Ch 2: Right People/Right Things/Right Way Assessment
- Ch 3: Your Authentic Core Values One-Pager
- **Culminating Activity**: FACE & PACE? (TBD)

### Phase: Strategy
- Ch 4: Your De-Hassle Action Plan
- Ch 5: Your Measurable Brand Promise
- Ch 6: Your One-Page Strategic Plan (OPSP)
- **Culminating Activity**: Strategic Snapshot (Brand Promise + OPSP + De-hassle priorities integrated)

### Phase: Execution
- Ch 7: Your Top 1 of 5 Focus
- Ch 8: Your Quarterly Theme Campaign
- Ch 9: Your Meeting Rhythm Calendar
- **Culminating Activity**: TBD

### Phase: Cash
- Ch 10: Your Cash Acceleration Plan
- **Culminating Activity**: Growth Scorecard (Critical Number + CCC + Key metrics dashboard)

## Deliverables & Flow

### Integrated Artifacts
Every phase produces a single integrated artifact.

### Flexible Entry
Skipped chapters? Built-in "minimum input" fallbacks — always move forward.

### Shareable Outputs
Designed for review, reuse, and easy sharing.

## Comparison: Previous Work vs. New HLD

| Criteria | Old HLD | New HLD |
|----------|---------|---------|

| Works for solo/small teams | ◐ | ✓ |
| Clear action vs. text ratio | ✓ | ✓ |
| Conceptual consistency | ◐ | ✓ |
| Clear deliverables | ◐ | ✓ |
| Matches book structure | ◐ | ✓ |

**Legend**: ✓ = Achieved | ✗ = Not achieved | ◐ = Partial

## Summary

- **Modular, action-focused learning** — No chapter depends on another
